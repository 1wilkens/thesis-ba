\section{Project setup}
\label{sec:Implementation::Setup}

As all applications written for this thesis have been developed on Linux the setup instructions are for this operating system. They \textbf{should} work on *nix as well but there is no definite guarantee this is the case. Also each section assumes the toolchains for the various languages are installed as this is largely different based on what operating system and on Linux which distribution is used. It is therefore not covered in this thesis.

\subsection{C}
\label{subsec:Implementation::Setup::C}

//TODO: Add footnotes/links

The buildtool for streets4C is GNU \textit{make} with a simple handcrafted \shinline{Makefile}. It was chosen to strike a balance between full blown build systems like \textit{Autotools} or \textit{CMake} and manual compilation. The setup steps required for this configuration are relatively straight forward and listed below.
\\
\lstinputlisting[caption={Project setup: streets4C}, label={lst:setup_c.sh}, style=shell]{code/setup_c}

After creatig a new directory for the application a \shinline{Makefile} and a sourcefile are created. \shinline{main.c} contains just a bare bones main method while the \shinline{Makefile} uses basic rules to compile an executable named streets4c with various optimization flags.

All in all the setup in C is quite painless although manual. The only caveat are Makefiles. They may be simple for small projects without real dependencies but as soon as different source and object files are involved in the compilation process they can get quite confusing. At that point the mentioned build systems might prove their worth in generating the \shinline{Makefile}(s) from other configuration files.


\subsection{Go}
\label{subsec:Implementation::Setup::Go}

//TODO: Add footnotes/links

For Go the choice of buildtool is nonexistent. The language provides the \shinline{go} executable which is responsible for nearly the complete development cycle. It can compile your code, install arbitrary Go packages from various sources, run tests and format code just to name the most common features.

This makes Go (the language) extremely convenient since everything you want to do is probably one commandline away. For example to get a dependency one would invoke the tool like so:
\mdinline{go get github.com/petar/GoLLRB/llrb}
\\
This will download the package in source form which can then be imported in any project on that machine via its fully qualified package name.

To achieve this convenience the \shinline{go} tool requires some setup work before it can be used for the first time. Because of this this section contains two setup examples.
\\
\lstinputlisting[caption={Project setup: streets4Go}, label={lst:setup_go.sh}, style=shell]{code/setup_go}

Listing \ref{lst:setup_go.sh} describes the steps that were taken to create the streets4go project inside the thesis' repository. It is pretty similiar to the C version. A directory gets creates then a source file containing a \shinline{main} function is created which can be build and run with a single command.

One thing to remind here is the fact, that this code does not live inside a globally set drectory called \shinline{GOPATH}. To be able to download packages only once \shinline{go} assumes an environment variable called \shinline{GOPATH} to be set to a directory which it has full control over. This directory contains all source files as well a the compiled binaries all stored through a consistent naming scheme. Normally it is assumed that all Go project live inside their own subdirectories of the \shinline{GOPATH} but it is possible to avoid this at the cost of some convenience.

The project that was created through the commands of listing \ref{lst:setup_go.sh} for example cannot be installed to the system by running \mdinline{go install} since it does not reside in the correct folder instead one has to copy the compiled binary to a directory in \shinline{PATH} manually.

The next listing shows a more realistic workflow for creating a new Go project from scratch without any prior setup required. It assumes one starts in the directory that should be set as \shinline{GOPATH} and assumes \url{www.github.com} as code host which in reality just determines the package name. It is also important to add the export shown in the first line to any inititalization file of your shell or operating system to ensure it always beeing available.

\subsection{Rust}
\label{subsec:Implementation::Setup::Rust}

//TODO: Add footnotes/links

Similar to Go also Rust provides its own build system. As mentioned in the \hyperref[subsec:State_of_the_art::Candidates::Rust]{candidate introduction} Rust installs its own package manager \textit{cargo}. It functions as build system and is also capable of creating new projects. This shortens the setup process considerably as observable in the next listing.
\\
\lstinputlisting[caption={Project setup: streets4Rust}, label={lst:setup_rust.sh}, style=shell]{code/setup_rust}

With the \shinline{new} subcommand a new project gets created. The \shinline{-{}-bin} flag tells \shinline{cargo} to create an executable project instead of a library which is the default.
Thanks to the one command all the initial files and directories are created with one single command. This includes:
\begin{itemize}
    \item{the project directory itself (named like the given project name)}
    \item{a \shinline{src} directory for source files}
    \item{a \shinline{target} directory for build results}
    \item{a required manifest file named \shinline{Cargo.toml} including the given project name}
    \item{a sample file inside \shinline{src} which is either called \shinline{main.rs} for binaries or \shinline{lib.rs} for libraries containing some sample code
    \item{and optionally an empty initialized version control repository (\shinline{git} or \shinline{mercurial} if the corresponding command line option has been passed)}
\end{itemize}
The resulting application is already runnable via \mdinline{cargo run}\footnote{which is executable anywhere inside the project directory} and produces some output in \shinline{stdout}. This process is extremely convenient and error proof since \shinline{cargo} validates all input before executing any task. The \shninline{man} pages and help texts are quite thin at the moment but as with everything in the Rust world \shinline{cargo} is still beeing developed.

The overall greated advantage however is that the Rust process does not involve any manual text editing. What might sound trivial at first, is actually quite important for newcomers to the language. You do not have to know any syntax to get started with Rust since the generated code already compiles and does something interesting. In the other languages you have to write a valid, minimal program manually to even test the project setup while Rust is ready to go after just one command.

Of course this strategy is not without limitations. To be able to use \shinline{cargo} all files and directories have to follow a special pattern. Although the chosen conventions are somewhat common one cannot use arbitrary directory and file names.


\subsection{Comparison}
\label{subsec:Implementation::Setup::Comparison}

For newcomers Rust definitely provides the best experience. One can get a valid \textit{Hello world!} application without any prior knowledge which lowers the barrier of entry dramatically. In addition Rust does not require any presetup before the first project. just install the language toolchain (either through the operating system's package manager or the very simple setup script~\fnote{\url{https://static.rust-lang.org/rustup.sh}}) and start coding.

Go required some intial setup besides the installation but it still quite easy to setup. The \shinline{GOPATH} exporting is a small annoyance but it balances out with the benefits the developer gets later down the line like easy dependency management. The syntax is very concise so creating a new source file with a \shinline{main} function is still quite fast.

Considering C's long lifespan the tooling for project setup is not very good. Full blown IDEs like Eclipse provide wizards to create all required files but for free standing development with a simple text editor and GNU \textit{make} there is no real automation possible. Naturally it is not hard to create an empty C source file however in this day and age it should not be necessary to manually have to adjust the order of linker flags in the \shinline{Makefile} because of obscure warnings in the compilation process.

This probably does not apply to seasoned C developers and one could make the argument that it is inherent to the language's ``closeness to the metal''. But acknowledging the fact that scientists more often than not see programming as an unwanted necessity to be able to complete their research it is questionable whether this technical know-how should really be required to use a language like C.

\subsection{C}
\label{subsec:Implementation::Counting::C}

Preface: For the first real milestone \textit{streets4C} had an important disadvantage. There was no library to conveniently process OpenStreetMap data. Therefore a small abstraction over the offical Protobuf definitions had to be written. The development time for this code located in \shinline{osmpbfreader.c/h} was not counted towards the total time of the phase to avoid unfair bias just because of a missing library and similarly the \gls{sloc} count does not include this code.

The first phase of development already highlighted many of the common problems encountered when programming in the C language. After finishing the aforementioned library it had to be invluded in the development process which in return meant the \shinline{Makefile} had to be extended to also compile \shinline{osmpbfreader.c} and include the resulting object file in assembling the executable binary. This proved harder than expected which can partly be attributed to my lacking expertise with the C compilation process but also confirms the unneeded complexity of such a simple task. In the end the problem was the order in which the sorce files and libraries where passed to the compiler. The libraries were included too early which resulted in ``undefined reference to method'' error messages. In times where compilers are smart enough to basically rewrite and change code for performance reasons it is completely inexcusable that the order of source arguments to process is still that relevant. The time spent solving these complication errors shows in the statistics for C which is considerably larger than its competitors in this stage.

The other big caveat in working with \gls{osm} data was the manual memory management. Since said data is stored in effectively compressed manner in the file additional heap allocations were unavoidable in accessing it. This requires either explicit freeing by the caller or a symmetric deallocation function provided by the library. In the case of Protobuf it is even worse since a client cannot just perform the usual \mdinline{free(..)} call but has to use the custom free functions generated from the source \shinline{.proto} format description files. For some intermediate allocations it is possible to limit this to the body of a libaray function but on the real data it shifts additional responsibilities on the caller.
\\
\lstinputlisting[caption={Manual memory management with Protobuf in C}, label={lst:manual_pbf_freeing.c}, style=c]{code/manual_pbf_freeing.c}

Considering this fact the \gls{sloc} count is still decent. With the help of a clever library interface the overhead for the memory management is comparatively small and the data is even loopable by a \shinline{while} loop which allows for convenient access and conversion. Also the statistics clearly show why C is still that dominant in the \gls{hpc} area. With low allocation counts~\fnote{Although these are also caused by the simplicity of the custom osmpbfreader abstraction} and superior singlethreaded(!) performance C is the clear winner in the performance area for this first milestone.

\subsection{Go}
\label{subsec:Implementation::Counting::Go}

To parse the .osm.pbf files \textit{streets4Go} uses an existing library simply called \shinline{osmpbf}~\fnote{\url{https://github.com/qedus/osmpbf}}. The library follows common Go ``best practices'' which makes it easy to use. Internally goroutines are used to decode data in parallel which can then be retrieved through a \shinline{Decoder} struct. The naming of the struct and the corresponding methods follow the conventions of the official Decoder types of the Go standard library. This adherence to conventions directly shows in the development time which is the shortes amongst the candidates for this first phase.
\\
\lstinputlisting[caption={Dependency management in Go}, label={lst:dependency_management.go}, style=go]{code/dependency_management.go}

Dependency management was very easy and intuitive. As mentioned in the \hyperref[subsec:State_of_the_art::Candidates::Go]{candidate introduction} \mdinline{go get} was used to download the library and a simple import statement was enough to pull in the necessary code (see \autoref{lst:dependency_management.go}). One caveat here is once again Go stricts compilation rules. Since an unused import is a compiler error an/my (//wording?) editor plugin kept deleting the prematurely inserted import statement as part of the saving process. While the auto fix style of tools like \shinline{gofmt} and \shinline{goimports} is certainly helpful for fixing common formatting errors, the loss of control for the developer takes some time to get used to. (//really include that?)

Another interesting recorded statistic is the count of \acrlong{sloc}. This count exposes one of the criticisms commonly directed at Go - verbose error handling. Although the code is semantically simpler (no manual memory management, higher level language constructs) the \gls{sloc} count is in fact identical to that of \textit{streets4C}. This is the result of the common four line idiom to handle errors. A function that could fail typically returns two values. The desired result and an error value. If the function failed to execute successfully the error value will indicate the source of the failed execution. Otherwise this value will be \shinline{nil} signalling a failure free completion. This pattern is used three times in this simple first phase alone which results in 12 lines.
\\
\lstinputlisting[caption={Idiomatic error handling in Go}, label={lst:error_handling.go}, style=go]{code/error_handling.go}

Considering the aforementioned simplicity \textit{streets4Go}'s performance characteristics are very promising. Although in its basic form about four to five times slower than the C solution the parallelized version achieves similar performance. This version was only included since the library was already based on a variable number of \glspl{goroutine} which made the parallelzation a matter of changing an environment variable in the Go runtime. While this change required only the addition of a single line, the C abstraction \shinline{osmpbfreader} might not even be parallelizable without considerable changes to its architecture. This truly shows the power of language level parallelization mechanics and confirms the choice of Go as a candidate in this evaluation.

\subsection{Rust}
\label{subsec:Implementation::Counting::Rust}

\textit{streets4Rust} also had the advantage of an existing library to use for \gls{osm} decoding which is called \textit{osmpbfreader-rs}~\fnote{\url{https://github.com/texitoi/osmpbfreader-rs}}. Similar to Go the dependency management was extremely convenient and simple. The only changes necessary were an added line in the Cargo manifest (Cargo.toml) and an \shinline{extern crate osmpbfreader;} in the crate root \shinline{main.rs}. After that \mdinline{cargo build} downloaded the dependency (which in this case meant cloning the \shinine{git} repository) and integrated it into the compilation process.

Compared to C and Go \textit{streets4Rust} required a medium amount of development time and had the lowest \gls{sloc} count in this phase. This can mainly be attributed to the library's use of common Rust idioms and structures like \shinline{iterators} and \shinline{enums}. Unlike C enums, which are basically named integer constants, the Rust variant provides a lot more features like beeing useable in pattern matching expressions. The next listing shows the complete decode part of this stage which is very compact and easy to understand.  //add implementation details of the lib? (chained interators)
\\
\lstinputlisting[caption={\gls{osm} decoding in Rust}, label={lst:osm_decoding.rs}, style=rust]{code/osm_decoding.rs}

The function \mdinline{blocks::iter} returns an enum value which gets pattern matched on to determine which counter should get incremented. While this example does not actually use any fields of the objects it would be a simple change to destructure the enum values and retrieve the structures containing the data.

The execution time highlights another important factor in regards to Rust's matureness as a language. The optimized version is more than ten times faster then the binary produced by default options. This is mostly due to the fact that the Rust \gls{llvm} frontend produces bloated byte code which does not get optimized on regular builds. That is also the reason release builds take substanstially longer. It simply takes more time to optimize (and therefore often shrink) \gls{llvm_ir} instead of emitting less code in the first place. Although the code generation gets improved steadily it is not a big focus until version \shinline{1.0} is released but the Rust core team knows about the issue and it is a high priority after said release.

Nontheless the release build shows the power of \gls{llvm}'s various optimization passes. \textit{streets4Rust} achieves the second best single threaded performance after C with a run time of 2.72 seconds which is impressive considering the vastly shorter development time and lowest \gls{sloc} count across all candidates.
