\chapter*{Abstract}

\thispagestyle{empty}

This thesis aims to analyze new programming languages in the context of HPC. To compare not only speed
but also development productivity and general inner metrics, a basic traffic simulation is implemented
in C, Mozilla's Rust and Google's Go. These two languages were chosen on their basic promise of
performance as well as memory-safety in the case of Rust or easy multhithreaded execution (Go).
The implementations are limited to shared-memory parallelism to achieve a fair comparison since the
library support for inter-process communication is rather limited at the moment.
\\
Nonetheless the comparison should allow a decent rating of the viability of these two languages in
high-performance computing.
