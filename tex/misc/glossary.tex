{beam}
{BEAM}
{Bogdan/Bj\"orn's Erlang Abstract Machine}
{The virtual machine which runs Erlang. It loads bytecode which is converted directly to threaded native code and executed.}
\newdualentry
{llvm_ir}
{LLVM IR}
{LLVM Intermediate Representation}
{A low level programming language similar to assembly. It is the code representation LLVM uses in its Core libraries. LLVM IR is platform-agnostic with the ``capability of representing `all` high-level languages cleanly.''~\cite{llvm_ir_ref}}
\newdualentry
{mpi}
{MPI}
{Message Passing Interface}
{The Message Passing Interface standard is a library specification developed by a committee of vendors, implementors and users. It is the current cominant model used in high-performance computing and implementations for many platforms (both commercial and free) are available including bindings for various programming languages.~\cite{mpi_main, mpi_infiniband}}
