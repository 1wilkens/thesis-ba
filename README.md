# thesis-ba

My bachelor's thesis titled "Evaluation of performance and productivity metrics of
    potential programming languages in the HPC environment".

### Building instructions

The thesis is written in LaTex so you will need a working Tex installation (usually TexLive on *nix systems) to compile it successfully. For convenience there is a shell script in the tex folder `build.sh` which will compile everything (including sources) and output a single file `thesis.pdf`.

Currently this file is also checked into git but that may change once the work is finished.

TL;DR

    $ git clone http://github.com/mrfloya/thesis-ba.git
    $ cd thesis-ba/tex
    $ ./build.sh
    $ <insert-pdfviewer> thesis.pdf

### TODO:
- Add abstract?
